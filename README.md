anagram-scanner
===============
This repository consists of the code and the executable files of an anagram scanner built for large input files. 
Two approaches have been used for acheiving fast scanning of large text bodies.
-> [Using regular string scanning methods and Hash tables] (code.c)
-> [Using Finite State Machine simulation. Will be much faster than the latter, hopefully in O(n) time] (fsm_simul.c)
